For every problem, create a run() method that should return the answer to the
problem's question. Some old solutions will not follow this convention.
If the problem does not return a primitive that can be passed to System.out's
Println, override toString().

There are some C++ solutions to problems that've been left in the laptop, one thing
I can do is rewrite the old solutions to follow the convention above and transfer
the C++ solutions here. Could get fancy and learn/use JNA.
